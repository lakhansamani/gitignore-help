# gitignore-help

##What is .gitignore ?
.gitignore is a hidden file, that we have in git repo. This file helps us mention about the files and
folders that we don't want to track.
For eg.
* build folder
* dependency files that will be generated when we build the code ```node_modules```

##Experiment
When we have more than one repo inside one git repo and we want to manage their individual gitignore file.

* We can create individual .gitignore file in each repo and write in each of them what to be ignored and what not
